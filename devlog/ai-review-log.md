### Changes Made to Announcements Component

**Files Modified:**
- `src/renderer/components/Announcements.tsx`

**Summary of Changes:**
1. Fixed duplicate state declarations for `announcements` and `setAnnouncements`
2. Updated `AnnouncementFormData` interface to include required fields
3. Fixed form data state management in create/edit flows
4. Improved error handling and type safety
5. Added proper toast notifications for user feedback

**Analysis:**
- **Type Safety:** Resolved TypeScript errors by ensuring proper type definitions and required fields
- **State Management:** Fixed issues with form state persistence during create/edit operations
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error handling with consistent toast notifications
- **Code Organization:** Removed duplicate code and improved component structure

**Auto-Fixes Applied:**

2. Fixed type mismatches in form submission handler
3. Ensured proper state reset after form submission

**Recommendations for Future Work:**
1. Implement proper authentication context for `authorId`
2. Add form validation for date ranges (end date after start date)
3. Consider adding loading states for better UX during API calls
4. Add unit tests for form validation and state management
5. Implement optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance

**Related Components:**
- `src/ui/components/Dialog.tsx` - Used for create/edit forms
