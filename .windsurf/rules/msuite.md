Use the parent file (DEVELOPMENT_JOURNEY.md) as full project context. Read and analyze it. Begin by summarizing implemented features, then proceed with implementing the next unfinished part.

From now on, every time you finish an edit or generate new code:

1. Re-analyze all related files that were changed or connected via imports.
2. Check for:
   - Logical consistency across modules
   - TypeScript errors or mismatches
   - Broken IPC calls or schema references
   - UI-state misalignment (e.g., Zustand store vs component use)
3. Log your analysis in a markdown file at `/devlog/ai-review-log.md` with:
   - Timestamp
   - What was changed
   - What you found after re-checking
   - Whether anything was auto-fixed
   - Suggestions for future improvements
4. Do not overwrite the file â€” always append.

This will serve as a living devlog written by you, Windsurf.
